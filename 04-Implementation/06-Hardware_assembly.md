# Hardware Assembly and Integration

The project demonstration of this project is dedicated to showcasing the photographic aspect of this research. The aim is to present the representations that will engage and help the readers to visualise the project. With this, communicating the findings of the research effectively, and create a lasting impression with the viewer long after they have finished reading this project. 

Herein, along with the 3D printed parts a pen, sharpener and an M3 fastener are also displayed which aims to present the viewers a rough idea on the dimensional specification of the printed parts. The entire assembly process hardly takes 10 min at maximum and one of the primary objectives was to build in such a way where the complexity of assembly should be minimal.
