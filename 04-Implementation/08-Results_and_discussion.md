# Results and Discussion

1. The total weight of the mechanism along with the wheels came out to be 0.496 kg. 
2. Theoretical geometrical analysis for ’Magic Air Ball Pattern’ was displayed which could help us obtain various governing equations of the origami wheel after changing the variable parameters. 
3. MATLAB was used to solve the geometrical equations resulting in a range of values(total values: 170) under the given dimensional constraints. The problem we faced was given the range of values we couldn’t infer the dimensions of the wheel in its undeformed and transformed state mathematically. 
4. The rotational movement of the pinion was performed with the help of Micro servo motor weighing 9g which was able to work on no load conditions rotating the pinion and thus driving the rack on the support shaft with little friction. 
5. Under origami transformation load, it was observed that micro servo motor having a running torque of 1.2 kg-cm was not sufficient to actually be able to transform the origami wheel.

# Scope for Future Work

1. An intensive research on load and kinematic analysis on the origami wheel structure could be implemented which plays a very crucial role in determining the right motor with the desire torque capacity to actually transform the structure. 
2. One of the ways to determine the load capacity for the wheel could be done with the help of Compression Tester using a load cell to determine the maximum and minimum load experimentally. 
3. With respect to advancement of this project, the goal is to take this research work forward into building an actual rover incorporating such wheel design with the developed mechanism. 
4. Simulating over a physical terrain would involve a control system ensuring a smooth feedback control to determine rovers position as well the state of its wheel. 
5. More research work could be done on the material where multi-layer patterning could be implemented with the right amount of tools and time.
