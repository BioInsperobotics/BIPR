# Our Implementation so Far
{: .no_toc}

This section aims to display the work we have done so far. 
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

## Objectives

Following are the number of objectives that this project aims to achieve: 
1. Geometrical analysis for Waterbomb pattern to ensure the dimensions of the structure in its undeformed and transformed state. 
2. Right material selection for Origami wheel structure for prototyping and perform a comparative analysis of different materials based on their stiffness, flexibility and the ability to deform. 
3. Force or Load analysis on the wheel structure when subjected to transformation with the help of actuation mechanism. 
4. Building an actuation mechanism to support the change of magic air ball from compressed state to expanded state. 
5. Addition of grouser support for extended diameter when expanded.
