# Our Implementation so Far
{: .no_toc}

The following would display the work we have done so far. 
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

- We have decided to go forth with dual level rack and gear mechanism for the actuation part of the origami inspired wheel.
- To focus on the wheel hub part 
	- Made of acrylic plate layered with plastic to support the triangular surfaces - should be hard enough to bend the surface so as to get a proper compression of the wheel.
- The figure below displays the general pattern for the "Magic Air Ball Pattern" that we will be going to use for now
