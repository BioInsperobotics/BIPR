## Mylar plastic sheet

1. References
    - [EurekAlert - Washington State University: Plastic fuel bellow](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/748739)
2. **Applications in Space**
    - A space blanket (also known as a Mylar blanket, emergency blanket, first aid blanket, safety blanket, thermal blanket, weather blanket, heat sheet, foil blanket, or shock blanket) is an especially low-weight, low-bulk blanket made of heat-reflective, thin, plastic sheeting
    - Mylar blanket or Space Blanket: the material comprises a thin sheet of plastic (often PET film) that is coated with a metallic, reflecting agent, making it metallized polyethylene terephthalate (MPET) that is usually gold or silver in color, which reflects up to 97% of radiated heat.
3. WSU researchers: origami inspired folded plastic fuel bladder that doesn't crack at super cold temperatures and could someday be used to store and pump fuel: Having never tried origami before, he said it took a couple tries and a few hours with a Youtube video to figure out how to fold the bellows. Once he folded it, he tested it in liquid nitrogen at about 77 degrees Kelvin. The researchers found that the bladder can be squeezed at least 100 times without breaking or leaking under cold conditions. They've since demonstrated the bellows numerous times, and it still doesn't have holes in it.
4. 32 layers are 0.45mm thick
5. usually waterproof and windproof
6. Mylar is an exceptionally strong, flexible, durable film with properties that make it extremely suitable for most industrial applications. Inert to water, Mylar polyester acts as a moisture barrier and is unaffected by oil, grease, and aromatics.
7. puncture resistant
8. transparent mylar film

## Polypropylene Sheets

1. References 
	- [https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/polymers/PP.aspx](https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/polymers/PP.aspx)
2. Polypropylene is one of those most versatile polymers available with applications, both as a plastic and as a fibre, in virtually all of the plastics end-use markets. 
3. The properties of Polypropylene include... 
	- Semi-rigid 
	- Translucent 
	- Good chemical resistance 
	- Tough 
	- Good fatigue resistance 
	- Integral hinge property 
	- Good heat resistance 
4. PP does not present stress-cracking problems and offers excellent electrical and chemical resistance at higher temperatures. 
5. These include a lower density, higher softening point (PP doesn't melt below 160oC) 
6. Disadvantages 
	- Oxidative degradation is accelerated by contact with certain materials, e.g. copper. High mould shrinkage and thermal expansion. High creep. Poor U.V. resistance. 
	- However, the poor impact resistance at low temperature and the corresponding space charge problem restrict the application of polypropylene with the extruded high voltage direct current (HVDC) cable 
7. Applications 
	- Buckets, bowls, crates, toys, medical components, washing machine drums, battery cases, bottle caps. Elastomer modified for bumpers, etc. Talc filled for additional stiffness at elevated temperatures - jug kettles, etc. OPP films for packaging (e.g. crisps, biscuits, etc.). Fibres for carpets, sports clothing.

	- [Dupont: Kapton - Summary of Properties](https://www.dupont.com/content/dam/dupont/amer/us/en/products/ei-transformation/documents/EI10142_Kapton-Summary-of-Properties.pdf)
2. A polyimide film
3. The ability of Kapton to maintain its excellent physical, electrical, and mechanical properties over a wide temperature range has opened new design and application areas to plastic films
	1. It has excellent chemical resistance; there are no known organic solvents for the film 
3. Kapton is self extinguishing (materials that flame in fire and extinguish by themselves when fire is removed)
4. Kapton polyimide film can be used in a variety of electrical and electronic insulation applications: wire and cable tapes, formed coil insulation, substrates for flexible printed circuits, motor slot liners, magnet wire insulation, transformer and capacitor insulation, magnetic and pressure-sensitive tapes, and tubing
5. Kapton is a polyimide film used in flexible printed circuits (flexible electronics) and space blankets, which are used on spacecraft, satellites, and various space instruments.

## SNU Wheel Fabrication

### WHEEL 1

1. Multimaterial patterning adopted rather than single-material patterning
2. PET film (100 mm; Kolami) with a thermal adhesive on one side and plain weave mesh fabric was used for the folding part.
3. Fabrication process
	- PET film attached to a weakly adhesive polyamide film
	- Mesh fabric is sandwiched between the two processed PET films
	- Sandwiched layers are put into a hydraulic hot press at 5MPa at a temperature of 110oC for 5 min and then cooled for 1h at room temperature.
	- the resin on the PET film melts and infiltrates the fabric, causing the PET to stick so strongly to the mesh that the facets are hard to peel off the fabric despite many foldings.

### WHEEL 2

1. Pattern embedded fabric
2. Fabrication process
	- Layer 1: Fabric
	- Layer 2: Adhesive Layer
	- Layer 3: PVC
	- Layer 4: Fabric
	- Sewing the fold line using Sewing Machine

## Deformable Wheel Ohio State University

1. 3D printing ABS directly on polyester flexure
	- Layer1: 0.1 mm polyester sheet
	- Layer2: 0.05 mm polyimide tape
	- The desired pattern was then perforated in the polyimide workpiece using laser cutter.
	- ABS glue mixture (ABS + acetone) was then painted onto the regions of the workpiece where rigid section would be printed.
	- Glue was spread on the polyimide side of the workpiece until a thin but opaque layer of ABS was deposited.

## Lamination Film + Paper

The origami wheel is displayed where a 3x8 section hand-folded from rectangular transparency film with 140 mm breadth and 280 mm width. The chassis namely shaft support mounted the two wheels. In addition, M2 fasteners and washers were used to connect the wheel hubs and linkages. The entire chassis support structure was 3D printed using PLA as the primary material.
