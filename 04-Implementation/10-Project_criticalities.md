**3D printing Double Rack and Pinion**

- The rack should incorporate a highly accurate helicoidal tooth profile which provides two distinct advantages 
	- Very good pitch accuracy and 
	- Sufficient tolerance of meshing conditions (within 0.25°). 
- This tooth form exhibits a high tolerance to misalignment when meshing with a straight-cut pinion and is ideal for harsh environments. Slight misalignment of the straight tooth pinion, in terms of deviation from a true right-angle between the axis and the rack in either plane, results merely in a change of position of the contact points across the face. 
- Features such as high reliability and repeatability ensure that rack and pinion systems are the first choice for linear and angular measurement applications 
- Actuation rack: Typical System Accuracy ±0.015 mm per 300 mm 

The above points highlighted the criticalities with respect to the system but 3D printing in itself poses a lot of tolerance issues. One should make sure that while 3D printing the models a sufficient amount of tolerance to the components should be given to avoid any unnecessary filing of the components consuming a lot of time and energy. 

**Origami folding with different Materials** 

Origami folding technique requires a lot of patience. One should ensure that prior patterning a folding makes it easier to pattern the structure with hands. Creases in the form of holes should be added to the vertices depending upon the material thickness. 

More rigid the material, more are the holes to be added.
