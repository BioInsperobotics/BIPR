The following documentation site has been built as part of our major project. The hardware and software implementation of this project was supported by our project guides in the Mechatronics Department at the <a href="https://www.sac.gov.in/">Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation</a> at Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

## ABSTRACT

Origami is an ancient paper folding technique that makes it simple to build and actuate devices ranging from small, scalable, and inexpensive robots to deployable engineering applications. The project describes the creation of a bistable origami-based changeable wheel transformation made by folding sheets of paper coated with various materials. The Waterbomb structure or Magic Air Ball pattern inspired the origami building block structure. We create a support shaft chassis construction with a double rack and a single pinion mechanism that retains the origami-inspired wheel and further modifies its shape. The project also presents a geometrical study of these structures based on linked joints and hinges. MATLAB was used to solve the geometrical equations leading to a range of values under the assumption of given dimensional constraints. 

This project lays a groundwork for future research in the field of development of wheel structure for various robotic applications in space targeting mini-scouting rovers which traverse along with a parent rover to the region of interest sites.
