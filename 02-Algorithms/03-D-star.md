# D* Algorithm - Wikipedia

### Operation
Like Dijkstra's algorithm and A*, D* maintains a list of nodes to be evaluated, known as the "OPEN list". Nodes are marked as having one of several states:

- NEW, meaning it has never been placed on the OPEN list
- OPEN, meaning it is currently on the OPEN list
- CLOSED, meaning it is no longer on the OPEN list
- RAISE, indicating its cost is higher than the last time it was on the OPEN list
- LOWER, indicating its cost is lower than the last time it was on the OPEN list

## Highlights & Notes

### Abstract
- Finding the lowest-cost path through a graph is central to many problems, including route planning for a mobile robot
- As the robot acquires additional information via its sensors, it can revise its plan to reduce the total cost of the traverse.
- During replanning, the robot must either wait for the new path to be computed or move in the wrong direction; therefore, rapid replanning is essential.
- The D* algorithm (Dynamic A*) plans optimal traverses in real-time by incrementally repairing paths to the robotâ€™s state as new information is discovered.

### Introduction
- The problem of path planning can be stated as finding a sequence of state transitions through a graph from some initial state to a goal state, or determining that no such sequence exists
