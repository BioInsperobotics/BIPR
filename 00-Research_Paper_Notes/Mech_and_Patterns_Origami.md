### Introduction

- Origami (from Japanese oru, to fold and kami, paper), is the ancient art of paperfolding.
- Once folded, the origami constitutes a developable surface that can be unfolded as a flat plane (it is isometric to a planar surface).
- In this article, we intend to present some overview of origami and origami-like structures and patterns, related to geometry
- Some origami models are strongly related to Euclidean geometry since the original material is a flat surface, and the folding steps may reproduce straightedge-and-compass constructions
