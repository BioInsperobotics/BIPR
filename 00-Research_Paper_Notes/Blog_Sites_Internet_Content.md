# Biomimicry is Real World Inspiration

### Metadata

- Title: Biomimicry is Real World Inspiration
- URL: [https://carnegiemnh.org/biomimicry-is-real-world-inspiration/](https://carnegiemnh.org/biomimicry-is-real-world-inspiration/)

### Highlights & Notes

- Our understanding of space, time and our place in nature are beyond that of other animals. But sometimes, we look to nature for inspiration. 
- Biomimicry is when we observe a trait in nature and copy it or parts of it for human technology and design.
- Scientists studied the pads on the toes of one species, the Tokay gecko, and discovered that tiny, microscopic hairs help them “stick” to surfaces.
- By mimicking gecko toes, we have developed adhesives, a way to close wounds without stitches, and more
- Learning how ant columns move can help us improve highway traffic, especially as autonomous vehicles develop.
- Humpback whale wind turbines. The ridges on the pectoral fins of humpback whales create an aerodynamic flow in water. They also inspired the shape of wind turbine blades.
- Spider web glass. A spider’s web is one of the strongest designs in nature. The webbing pattern has been copied by automotive industries so that windshields crack but do not shatter.

- URL: [Rethinking Future - Architecture Projects](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/architectural-community/a6476-reasons-you-should-start-using-biomimicry-in-your-design-projects-right-now/)

### Highlights & Notes

- biomimicry is just the idea of using the natural design of the environment to inspire our design projects.
- Biomimicry works on the principle that nature has already come up with solutions to many of the problems we are trying to fix in its 3.8-billion-year history.
- The application of biomimicry and bio-utilization can contribute to sustainable building materials and projects. Biomimicry is based on life’s principles
- We definitely can and should find a new way that not only benefits humans but the natural environment as well
